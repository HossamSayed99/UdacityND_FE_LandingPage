## Description

This is the landing page project required in Udacity's Front-End Nano Degree. I adjusted the java script file to add the following functionalities:
* Making the navbar dynamic according to the number of sections in the page.
* Change the section that is currently being viewed by the user.
* When a user clicks on an item, the page scroll instead of jumps.
